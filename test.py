video_transcript = "This is Master Gu and this is me George some British guy this is my story of how becoming a Tai Chi monk in the distant mountains of China changed my life and how what I learned out there could change yours without you needing to travel. My story began in 2017 when I finished education I descended into confusion and anxiety beating myself up for not knowing what I was doing with my life a new character began to dominate my head space, who I called the underminer and hoping I could find some peace from the underminer I set off on a journey. Deep in the mountains of China I tried to get into a Kung Fu Monastery. I wasn't getting anywhere with that, asked the locals to help but they brought me instead to a small Tai Chi school. I thought Tai Chi that's for older people but I tried it and fell in love with it. I met Master Gu he just so happened to be the only master that was fluent in English on the whole mountain and he guided me into the beautiful world of the ancient philosophy of Daoism I'd never heard of Daoism before but as I learned more how I talked to myself began to change. I was guided to accept my whole self even the frustrating bits I didn't like to get out of my head and into my body and to relax into being okay that I didn't have everything worked out.My head space transformed I found some peace and then I needed some money so 6 months later I came back home and started a job. The End. Except I still had my challenges, sometimes I'd be up all night worrying about what was happening in the world and I knew that I'd only scratch the surface of this ancient culture still alive in far away China. I wondered what if I went back if you sometimes struggle with your resilience and wanting to find meaning and purpose then you're not alone. Could our modern problems have ancient solutions. It is the time you come back to Wudang. So I'm going to try and get back to the living heart of this wonderful philosophy on the other side of the planet 12,000 km away I'm not gonna fly [Music] [Music] I'm walking on a lake I'm walking on a lake who would have thought it's possible it's a frozen lake and I'm on it. I managed to get halfway across the Eurasian continent but then disaster hit. The city at the heart of a Public Health crisis in China is shutting its public transport network to try to prevent the spread of a virus. oh George uh the situation becomes serious come as soon as possible. New Year celebrations cancelled. Pressure is building to completely isolate China. Two more Chinese cities have joined Wuhan [Music] I made it into China 3 days before they locked their border. I was in an intense lockdown thankfully a Tai Chi teacher friend had given me refuge during the storm 6 weeks later I saw an opportunity to try and get to the mountain where Master Gu is waiting. Thank you so much for having me. This is it Wudang Mountains. It's been two years [Music] Somehow I made it to the birthplace of Tai Chi on the other side of the planet in a global pandemic we started this journey searching for resilience and ideas that might help you and I and humanity live in peace. Another name for the Wudang Mountains is Supreme Harmony Mountain one of the few Daoist communities still surviving in industrialized communist China. There were monasteries, Kung Fu schools, Tai Chi schools, hermits living in caves. For thousands of years, people here have dedicated themselves to Daoist ideas and practices in order to achieve Supreme Harmony. Well that would be pretty cool but we're modern people living in the 21st century could these ideas and practices help us too? Living like a Tai Chi monk we had a simple daily routine. We'd wake up early, go for a walk, then practice Tai Chi. Tai Chi is a moving meditation a beautiful way to get out of your head and into your body and into the present moment. We also meditated. Meditation being the fundamental practice discovered all over the world to help us see the nature of reality instead of just being lost in our thoughts. I was finding more peace but I guess it's easier out here I still hadn't got any clearer about what could help with our big challenges nor how I could spend 5 minutes on my computer without getting overwhelmed. Thankfully sometimes Master Gu and I would sit down together and he would share some ideas from Daoism. The common people might see the universe it's like a chaos you see the grass, the tree, they don't they don't you know very parallel like this way the rivers are you know not a straight line, or not a totally a round shape.A good word is they just grow naturally. Just like we see the Tai Chi you see okay here we have the the Yang part, Yin part but please notice outer there is a very beautiful round shape this means our whole world there's no matter how complicated change or the yin-yang change, in general, it's beautifully harmonious union. If Division and Chaos are an essential part of the greater balance and harmony of the natural world could that be true for us too. It's a challenging idea because if you're anything like me you try and hide from darkness, chaos, the bad parts of yourself and life that you don't like this is where it hurts. With my body I found myself in increasing pain during my practice. Who would have thought it's possible to get injured doing gentle Tai Chi. In fact it's getting worse but I was so caught up with the desire to improve, I tried to ignore the pain. I denied its value until eventually I needed help. It's a bit painful. He's getting in the good spots. I did not recognize that the pain was feedback from the greater harmony of my body guiding me to change my practice. If we see it in the right way any challenge in our lives can be our teacher. The yin-yang reminds us to be flexible and open to this possibility. On our journey towards understanding the world and finding resilience the ying-yang is a powerful idea but why is it then that life often doesn't feel harmonious. In what sense is there harmony in our big social problems.Surely there's too much stuff in the real world to fix. "
